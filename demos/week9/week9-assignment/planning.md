# Tips for a successful planning stage

## Draw your wireframe

- Tools: Figma, Ok so, Excalidraw...
- Purpose: to see our app from the user's point of view.

## Plan your database schema

- Tools: drawsql
- Purpose: to organise our data and to have a clearer idea of the data you need to manipulate.
- Questions: how many tables do I need? What is the relationship between the tables?

## Set up your database tables using your schema

- Tools: SQL editor on Supabase.
- Purpose: to create our tables and seed dummy data.

## Set up your app

- Tools: Next.js
- Purpose: to have an interface to interact with the user.

## Upload the project to GitHub

## Deploy your app to Vercel

## (optional, but highly recommended) Organise your tasks in Trello.

## Version control: use each assignment as an opportunity to get better at branches, and pushing code to GitHub.

## Environments: set up .env files in your app to store environment variables and API urls
