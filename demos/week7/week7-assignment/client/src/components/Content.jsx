//TODO: render the database data sent through the server
// - store data in state
// - fetch the values from the server --> this is an effect
// - once you fetch teh data, parse it to JSON --> console log it!
// - update state with the fetched data (maybe some wrangling?)
// - poll your database to keep your data updated --> this is an effect
// - render the list of content
//? - you could conditionally render some elements in your page
